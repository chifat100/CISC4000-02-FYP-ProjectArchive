The entire app development environment is based on the software versions 
mentioned above. To run the register part of the app, you first need to 
modify the email information in the class-EmailSender. There will be 
comments in the code indicating where the modifications are needed. 
Next, you need to update the MySQL connection in the class-MySQLConnect 
and implement the database structure using the provided MySQL script file. 
For the subsequent file upload functionality, you will need to register for 
Firebase Storage, follow the app development usage guide, download the 
corresponding google-services.json file, and replace the original file in the 
app directory.
